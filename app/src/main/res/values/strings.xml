If the letter does not exist, the hangman will be incremented and you will be one step closer to losing.\n\nEach time you guess a letter, the letter disappears - meaning you can't guess the same letter again.\n\nThe hangman will be incremented in the following order: head, body, arm, arm, leg, leg and dead."</string>
